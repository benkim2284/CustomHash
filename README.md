# CustomHash
Created a Custom HashCode 

Java's default hashcode is pretty bad, so I attempted to make a better one!
This hashcode minimizes any repeats of keys, and utilizing this to overwrite Java's 
hashcode will ensure that anytime you implement a hashmap with this hashcode, security
and efficiency won't have to be worried about!
